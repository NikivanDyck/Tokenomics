# Tokenomics
Theory of how blockchain tokens are conceptualized, produced, valued, distributed, traded, and used. 

## What is a Token 
Tokens could represent any asset that is of value to the potential buyers.  Examples: equity in the company (as in a traditional IPO), a promise of future payment, or a tangible asset such as a boat or car.  They might also represent some sort of utility or benefit related to the company’s blockchain application or services, such as extra privileges on the system or exclusive or early access.  In a gaming system, for example, a token might represent a special or unique item in the game.  Regardless of the asset a token represents, the blockchain uses a particular type of smart contract to encode the details of the value of a token.  

How blockchain tokens are valued, distributed, or traded creates a value within the economy of tokens.  Because tokens are powered by blockchain, they can be traded globally without involving traditional financial or physical infrastructure.  For example, transferring a metric ton of gold requires a lot of energy.  Transferring tokens representing that metric ton of gold requires significantly less energy, and the blockchain’s borderless nature means that the transfer is not geographically limited.

## Coins vs. Tokens
Coins represent cryptocurrencies that are native to their blockchains—such as Bitcoin or ether.  Tokens represent any tangible or intangible asset of value and are created by deploying smart contracts over existing blockchain platforms.


## The difference between fungible and non-fungible tokens
Some tokens represent assets whose values are interchangeable and exchangeable.  These tokens are called fungible.  Tokens representing fiat currency or cryptocurrency often fall into this category.  A token representing one ether, for example, holds the same value as and is interchangeable with another token that represents one ether.  Tokens representing other types of assets can be fungible, too.  For example, consider tokens that represent votes: any individual’s vote holds equal power to any other individual’s vote, so the tokens representing their votes would have equivalent value.

Tokens that represent stores of value that are not directly comparable and interchangeable are called non-fungible.  Some examples of non-fungible goods include real-estate properties, diamonds, and collectibles.  You could own a parcel of land in San Diego and a parcel of land in Pennsylvania.  These two land parcels are different and hold different values and are therefore not interchangeable.  The same could be said for different collectible figures, like a Pop Vinyl and a Beanie Baby; each collectible is unique.

Similarly, non-fungible blockchain tokens represent goods or assets that are not equivalently valuable and are not interchangeable.  Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, can represent almost any type of asset or store of value that you can imagine.
